cd to the ViralChat directory.

Compile the idl:
idlj -fall Chat.idl
This puts the generated files in directory Chat.

Compile the handwritten and generated java code:
javac *.java Chat\*.java

1. Run the application with 3 clients.

Start up a naming service (runs orbd in the background):
start orbd -ORBInitialPort 1050 -ORBInitialHost localhost

In order to capture the output of the server and the clients, we want to redirect standard output. But since each is started up as a background process, the command must go in a .bat file. (Otherwise the output of the 'start' command goes to std out, rather than the output of the 'java' command.)

Start up the Chat server:
start server

Start up three clients:
start rachel
start sarah
start herbie
